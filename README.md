# ERC20-token-creator
## A platform for users to create an ERC20 token on ethereum blockchain and launch an ICO sale within seconds.

## Goals
1. Swift token creation: Developing an easy to use simple UI which takes the parameters
like token name, token symbol, number of tokens to be created and token price.
2. Managing multiple tokens: Efficiently managing multiple instances of the token contract
by keeping track of different token deployments and their owners and current status of
the respective ICO sales.
3. One stop portal: Creating a single portal to create new ERC20 tokens, launching ICO
sales, buying other ERC20 tokens created on the platform, managing the ICO sale by
owner and a portfolio page to show balances of various tokens at one place.
4. Managing the ICO sale: The owner or creator of the token will be able to add tokens to
the sale or end sale at any time through an easy to use UI. While other users can choose
to participate in ICO sales by buying the tokens.
